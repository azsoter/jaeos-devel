/rtos-extensions
================

Practical, functional software can be created using only the features included in the _/rtos_ folder and features build on top of the
published API (such as things under _/extras_).

Some programmers may like to have other features commonly found in an RTOS, which are not practical to implement on top of the API and
need knowledge of the internal workings of the OS.

Since I do not consider them to be essential, I wanted to emphasize their optional nature by placing them into
a separate directory on the tree. So _/rtos-extensions_ was born.
