Just Another Embedded OS -- Development Version

The acronym JaeOS is pronouced as _jay_-_oh_-_es_.

Even though there are plenty of operating systems for embedded applications ranging
from school assignment projects to full-featured commertial ones with support, I have
decided that I needed my own with just the features that __I__ wanted.

__THE MAIN LINE OF THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS THE DEVELOPMENT VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE, WHICH IS WORK IN PROGRESS POTENTIALLY WITH SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS MISSING OR UNSTABLE.__
__Use it at your own peril.__

__More stable versions are published in the Stable-X.X.X branches, those are better candidates for more serious projects.__

__Please remember that JaeOS is free software and it comes without any warrantee, or guarantee of any kind.__

__You must evaluate and decide for yourself if it meets the needs and requirements of your project.__
