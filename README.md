Just Another Embedded OS -- Stable Branch

Version 1.0.x.

The acronym JaeOS is pronouced as _jay_-_oh_-_es_.

Even though there are plenty of operating systems for embedded applications ranging
from school assignment projects to full-featured commertial ones with support, I have
decided that I needed my own with just the features that __I__ wanted.

__THIS IS A STABLE BRANCH__
It means that I have been using it for a while unchanged and it appears to work as designed.
Please do understand that __there is no guarantee__ that it is suitable for any particular purpose you may want to use it for.

If you decide to use it, you must evaluate for yourself if it meets the requirements of your project.

__Warning:__
SMP features are still considered to be experimental in this version.
While they do appear to work in test programs I have not even tried to use them in any serious project,
and they have very little milage on them.
